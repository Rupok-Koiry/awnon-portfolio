                      AN ADAPTIVE CRYPTOSYSTEM ON A FINITE FIELD
                    </a>
                  </h4>
                  <p align="justify" className="mb-2">
                    <b>Abstract:</b> Owing to mathematical theory and
                    computational power evolution, modern cryptosystems demand
                    ingenious trapdoor functions as their foundation to extend
                    the gap between an enthusiastic interceptor and sensitive
                    information. This paper introduces an adaptive block
                    encryption scheme. This system is based on product,
                    exponent, and modulo operation on a finite field. At the
                    heart of this algorithm lies an innovative and robust
                    trapdoor function that operates in the Galois Field and is
                    responsible for the superior speed and security offered by
                    it. Prime number theorem plays a fundamental role in this
                    system, to keep unwelcome adversaries at bay. This is a
                    self-adjusting cryptosystem that autonomously optimizes the
                    system parameters thereby reducing effort on the userâ€™s side
                    while enhancing the level of security. This paper provides
                    an extensive analysis of a few notable attributes of this
                    cryptosystem such as its exponential rise in security with
                    an increase in the length of plaintext while simultaneously
                    ensuring that the operations are carried out in feasible
                    runtime. Additionally, an experimental analysis is also
                    performed to study the trends and relations between the
                    cryptosystem parameters, including a few edge cases.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> This paper outlines an encoding schematic
                    that is dependent on simple Cartesian coordinate
                    transformations. Namely, the change of axes and the rotation
                    of axes. A combination of these two is incorporated after
                    turning singular ASCII values into 2D points. This system is
                    based on multiple private keys that can also act as a
                    potential candidate for threshold cryptography.
                    Comprehensive initial testing has been performed on certain
                    parameters by altering their values within a range. Further
                    testing is required for more insights about the system. For
                    now, the list of parameters that amounts to successful
                    decryption is to be noted down for future use with this
                    system.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> As mathematical theory has evolved and
                    computing capabilities have improved, what initially seemed
                    to be adequately difficult trapdoor functions, were deemed
                    not to be later. In this paper, a new block-encryption
                    scheme named Modern Encryption Standard (MES) is proposed
                    based on the multiple concepts arising from number theory
                    for a highly secure and fast cryptosystem that can be
                    considered as an alternative to the existing systems. This
                    is a block cipher like AES, but the inherent algorithm is
                    quite different. The security of the proposed MES algorithm
                    stands on the fundamentals of the Chinese Remainder Theorem,
                    Cantor Pairing Function and the Prime Number Theorem for
                    creating an ingenious trapdoor function. Breaking this
                    algorithm proves to be quite a daunting obstacle to overcome
                    for an unwelcome interceptor.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> In recent years cyber-attacks are
                    continuously developing. This means that hackers can find
                    their way around the traditional cryptosystems. This calls
                    for new and more secure cryptosystems to take their place.

                    curve fractal. The security level of this scheme is based on
                    multiple private keys, that are crucial for effective
                    encryption and decryption of data. This paper discusses, how
                    core concepts emerging from fractal geometry can be used as
                    a trapdoor function for this cryptosystem.

                      ENHANCING THE NTRU CRYPTOSYSTEM

                    <b>Abstract:</b> NTRU is an open-source public key
                    cryptosystem that uses lattice-based cryptography to encrypt
                    and decrypt data. Unlike other popular public-key
                    cryptosystems, it is resistant to attacks using Shor's
                    Algorithm and its performance has been shown to be
                    significantly greater. This paper talks about how Koblitz
                    encoding from Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) can be used
                    to convert each character in a dataset to a point on an
                    elliptic curve. A sum of squares analogy is pitted against
                    the cantor pairing function to turn the point to a single
                    number, which is converted to a sequence of coefficients in
                    â„¤. A polynomial is then generated for each of these
                    characters. Then the polynomial is reduced, and then shown
                    that choosing appropriate parameters for the cryptosystem
                    can make it highly secure and that the decryption algorithm
                    turns out taking linear time. Since each character is
                    represented by its own polynomial, it increases obscurity
                    thereby increasing the complexity for decryption and thus
                    the security level. A form of data compression has also been
                    implemented and it has been tested whether data compression
                    and expansion during the encryption-decryption process
                    results in original data with no or minimal loss.

                      The program gave students the opportunity to redo the

                      course to reduce or eliminate the number of basic skills

                      with a tutor in a small group or one-on-one setting. Upon
                      completion of the tutorial program, students are able to
                      test in order to satisfy their basic skills requirement
